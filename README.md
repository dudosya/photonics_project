# Photonics Project

This repository contains a Python simulation for eye diagram analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dudosya/photonics_project.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd photonics_project
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If this command fails, you might need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    or, as a last resort, try this, but not recommended:
    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
